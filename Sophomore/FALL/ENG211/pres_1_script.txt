Hello everyone, I am Göktuğ. Today I am going to introduce myself and talk about some fun facts about me. As I said my name is Göktuğ Ekinci, I am 20 years old and sophomore student at the department of computer engineering. My hometown is Nevşehir, with other word, Cappadocia. Here are some fun facts about me. I like solving rubic cubes, and for the classical one, my record is 18 seconds. About a month my hair was long, I needed a change, so I cut my hair. I have two cats whose names are Yıldız and Güneş. Here are their photos. Actually I took role in few club. One of them is IEEE. I was the chairperson of Self Development and Education Committee at my freshman year, and this year, for now, I am the lead of Community & PR lead at Google Developer Student Club. Actually that's it. If you have any questions about me, I can try to answer them.
