# How many different runs
number_of_runs=8

# Each state is: input1,input2,input3,....;desired_output1,desired_output2,desired_output3,..
# Outputs can be X. Inputs cannot be
#
# There is a special state: "if OUTPUTS then goto STATE-NO at most XXX times"
# Used for waiting for clock-dependent outputs (give the circuit clock until FIN=1)
# "at most XXXX times" is to prevent infinite loops. Run will fail if "at most XXX times" fail
#
# A run will fail if it cannot pass the last state. A run will succeed if it passes the last state.
#
# Each run will start with a circuit-reset (Simulate->Reset Simulation menu)
