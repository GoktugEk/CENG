Then, they play a number of matches against opponents with similar rankings, and their rankings are adjusted based on the results. This method is useful for situations where the rankings of the players are already established, but need to be updated based on recent performances. In this section, we will implement a Rank Adjustment Tournament in Python, where players are initially seeded based on their previous rankings, and then play matches against each other. The results of each match will be used to adjust the rankings of the players, and the final ranking will be determined based on the adjusted scores.\n"
